## What is wrong with Good Ol' FieldGroup?

Vaadin's `FieldGroup` and `BeanFieldGroup` are non-visual components that build and automatically bind `Field`s to a data source. The data source may be an `Item` or a Java Bean. However, `FieldGroup`s have quite a few limitations:

* A FieldGroup only contains *bound* fields
* If a field is not bound to a datasource (using `unbind()`), then it is automatically *removed* from the FieldGroup. The FieldGroup is then unaware that the field exists. Trying to `getField()` returns `null`.
* A FieldGroup cannot `buildAndBind()` fields with unrecognized values, but it is extensible through a Factory; however, unrecognized values include `Collection` types, such as `List`s, which are typical of forms of the Master/Detail-type  
* There is no generic implementation of a standard Master/Detail editor (the JPAContainer `MasterDetailEditor` implementation is ad-hoc)
* There is no way to bind a FieldGroup to a Container: a FieldGroup is bound to an Item. Thus, there is no simple way to scan through a collection of records and display their contents in a form

## Meet the FieldBinder

The `FieldBinder` add-on is an advanced FieldGroup implementation. 

Features:

* A `FieldBinder<T>` binds to a Java Bean, like a BeanFieldGroup
* Managed Fields (built using `build()`) can be always `bind()`'ed and `unbind()`'ed; the FieldBinder will always keep track of them
* A FieldBinder can build() and bind() a component that displays a bean property even when it is a List<T>
* A FieldBinder can be bound to a Container. The `DataNavigation`Â interface provides commands to move an internal pointer to the next, previous, first and last Item in the Container (the Container must implement `Container.Ordered`)
* The `DataNavigation` interface provides commands to scan through a dataset and retrieving the `Item` that it points to.
* The `DataNavigation` interface provides standard behavior for performing CRUD operations (and, experimentally, lookup operations), which can be extended through a regular, Vaadin-style listener mechanism
* `FieldBinder` comes with standard built-in CRUD for the ListContainer and the [Lazy Mongo Container](https://github.com/tyl/mongodbcontainer-addon). The ListContainer should already cover most Java Bean use-cases, including JPA. Support for the Vaadin's official JPAContainer is under development.  


## Maven


Add `field-binder` to your Maven dependencies

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.tylproject.vaadin.addon.masterdetail</groupId>
			<artifactId>field-binder</artifactId>
			<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>
```

If you want to use the SNAPSHOT version, install the package and its dependencies locally, using the script:

```sh
  $ ./download-and-install.sh 
```


## Demo (for the impatient)

Want to give an immediate look at the FieldBinder? Try the demo:

```sh
  $ cd demo
  $ mvn package && java -jar target/field-binder-demo-1.0.jar  
```

or simply:

```sh
  $ cd demo
  $ ./run.sh
```

The demo uses [vaadin4spring](https://github.com/peholmst/vaadin4spring) for convenience, and implements the two tutorials that follow.

## Short Tutorial
We will create a simple Address Book, where each `Person` may have many `Address`es. 
For conciseness, we will also use the [Maddon](https://github.com/mstahv/maddon) addon, its `ListContainer` and the shorthand classes for Layouts. You do not need to add any further dependencies to your `pom`, though. The `field-binder` add-on depends on `Maddon` already. Let us write the following bean class for the Addresses:

```java
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String zipCode;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    public Address() {}
    /* ...getters and setters... */
}
```

and the Person entity:

```java
public class Person {
   private String firstName;
   private String lastName; 
   private Integer age;
   private Date birthDate;
   private List<Address> addressList = new ArrayList<Address>();
   public Person() {}
   public Person(String firstName, String lastName) {
     this.firstName = firstName;
     this.lastName = lastName;
   }
   
   /* ...getters and setters... */
}
```

Now you are ready to define your Vaadin `UI`

```java
@Title("Short Tutorial")
@Theme("valo")
public class ShortTutorial extends UI {
  
  // CONTAINER
  
  // initialize an empty container
  final FilterableListContainer<Person> container = 
                                    new FilterableListContainer<Person>(Person.class);
  
  // FIELD BINDER 
  // initialize the FieldBinder for the given container
  final FieldBinder<Person> binder = new FieldBinder<Person>(Person.class, container);

  // initialize the layout, building the fields at the same time
  final VerticalLayout mainLayout = new MVerticalLayout(

      // auto-generates a button bar with the appropriate behavior
      // for the underlying FilterableListContainer
      new ButtonBar(binder.getNavigation().withDefaultBehavior()),

      new MFormLayout(
          binder.build("firstName"),
          binder.build("lastName"),
          binder.build("birthDate"),
          binder.build("age"),
          
          // optional: display the index of the currentItem in the container
          new NavigationLabel(binder.getNavigation()) 

      ).withFullWidth().withMargin(true),

      // initialize the addressList field with the built-in button bar
      binder.buildListOf(Address.class, "addressList").withDefaultEditorBar()


  ).withFullWidth().withMargin(true);


  @Override
  protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
    setContent(mainLayout);
  }

}
```

Start the Vaadin application and have fun!

## Extended Tutorial

In this version of the tutorial we will extend the regular editing behavior of the `DataNavigation` component with custom logic, using the built-in event listener system.

Let us start from the previous tutorial, in which we built a `Person` editor, with a detail view of the `Address` list. Each `Person` of the previous example contained an `age` field. As you have probably noticed, the `age` field is actually a function of the `birthDate` field: `age` is the difference in years between the current date and the `birthDate` of a `Person`. Let us implement a custom `BeforeCommit` listener that will update the `age` field with a computed value.
 
In order to simplify the writing of the custom events, it is advisable to assign the generated Fields to instance variables of the class; so, refactor them out as follows:

```java
  final TextField firstName = binder.build("firstName");
  final TextField lastName  = binder.build("lastName");
  final DateField birthDate = binder.build("birthDate");
  final TextField age       = binder.build("age");
  
  final ListTable<Address> addressList = binder.buildListOf(Address.class, "addressList")
                                               .withDefaultEditorBar();
```   

Then, the layout should be updated accordingly:

```java
  // initialize the layout
  final VerticalLayout mainLayout = new MVerticalLayout(

      new ButtonBar(binder.getNavigation().withDefaultBehavior()),

      new MFormLayout(
          firstName, lastName, birthDate, age,
          new NavigationLabel(binder.getNavigation())
      ).withFullWidth().withMargin(true),

      addressList

  ).withFullWidth().withMargin(true);
```


Now, let us write the custom actions as event listener. For convenience, we may define a separate class. 

```java

class MyController implements BeforeCommit.Listener {
  @Override
  public void beforeCommit(BeforeCommit.Event event) {
    // e.g., using JodaTime:
    DateTime birthDateValue = new DateTime(birthDate.getValue());
    int ageValue = Years.yearsBetween(birthDateValue, DateTime.now()).getYears();

    age.setConvertedValue(ageValue);
  } 
}

```

then, let us add the event listener to the `DataNavigation` of the `FieldBinder`

```java
  @Override
  protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
    setContent(mainLayout);
    
    DataNavigation dataNav = binder.getNavigation();
    MyController controller = new MyController();
    dataNav.addBeforeCommitListener(controller);
  }
```

Start the application, and you're set!

### Final Touches

Since `age` is now a computed field you may want to set the *age* field to read-only to prevent users from modifying it. In this case, you may want to hook into the `ItemEdit` and `ItemCreate` events, and update the `BeforeCommit` listener accordingly:

```java
class MyController implements ItemEdit.Listener, ItemCreate.Listener, BeforeCommit.Listener {

  @Override
  public void itemEdit(ItemEdit.Event event) {
    age.setReadOnly(true);
  }

  @Override
  public void itemCreate(ItemCreate.Event event) {
    age.setReadOnly(true);
  }

  ...
  @Override
  public void beforeCommit(BeforeCommit.Event event) {
    // e.g., using JodaTime:
    DateTime birthDateValue = new DateTime(birthDate.getValue());
    int ageValue = Years.yearsBetween(birthDateValue, DateTime.now()).getYears();

    age.setReadOnly(false);
    age.setConvertedValue(ageValue);
    age.setReadOnly(true);
      
  }
}
```

don't forget to register the new event listeners:

```java
  @Override
  protected void init(VaadinRequest request) {
    setContent(mainLayout);
    DataNavigation dataNav = binder.getNavigation();

    MyController controller = new MyController();

    dataNav.addItemEditListener(controller);
    dataNav.addItemCreateListener(controller);
    dataNav.addBeforeCommitListener(controller);
  }
```

Now restart the application and see the result. 

## Architecture

tbd


### DataNavigation

The `DataNavigation` interface defines several events that you can listen to 

* Navigation Events:
	* FirstItem
	* NextItem
	* PrevItem
	* LastItem
	* CurrentItemChange

Because the Navigation object maintains an internal state, that is, a pointer to the "current" item id, for each other navigation event,  the `CurrentItemChange` event always fires. Therefore, if you want to hook into *every* navigation event, then you should listen to `CurrentItemChange`.

* CRUD events
	* ItemCreate
	* ItemEdit
	* ItemRemove
	* AfterCommit, OnCommit, BeforeCommit
	* OnDiscard

For instance, in order to listen to the `CurrentItemChange` event on the `binder` component use:

```java
binder.getNavigation().addCurrentItemChangeListener(new CurrentItemChange.Listener(){
    public void currentItemChange(CurrentItemChange.Event event) {
       // display the updated current itemId in a notification
       Notification.show(event.getNewItemId());
    }
});
```
